# Speak Truth to DNS

This repository contains two directories: `elemental-utils` and `elemental-scripts`.

The `elemental-utils` directory contains Python
modules to aid in interaction between NetBox, Cisco Prime Network Registrar, Hashicopr Vault, and TrueNAS.  Install these modules
by running `make install` from within the `elemental-utils` directory.

The `elemental-scripts` directory contains a few scripts for integrating Cisco Prime Network Registrar with NetBox, as well as
allowing NetBox entries to update Umbrella internal networks.
